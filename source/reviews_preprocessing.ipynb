Malt palate has pale malt with white bread and biscuits. With the mineral body, and the carbohydrate palate, the palate is pushed towards the taste memory of a clear broth ramen.

       "  'Bottle from Honest Brew. Not quite clear on the ABV - think it may have 4.5% printed on it, but not quite clear on the label, and it changes regularly? Advertised at 4.1% on the shop site. Slightly hazy light straw colour, very high apparent carbonation. Aroma of citrus/lime peel and some sour / tangy notes. Very floral in the mouth with, oddly, a decent amount of lager-beer alongside fairly subtle standard farmhouse saison yeastiness. Light on the finish too, some mild white pepper and some cereal sweetness. Very drinkable and fresh, but could do without the slightly oversweet finish. Fairly atypical saison - more like a lager/saison hybrid. ',\n",

Muted fruity aroma of natural passionfruit juice with a lemony sweetness, some quark lacto underneath. Drinks duller than it smells, with a straightforward yeast profile and grainy body that flatten out the fruit aromas, landing at ACE multivitamin juice with earthy carrot juice. Manageable carbonation. - Saison as a \"fruit-infused sour\" being off US crafty offspring opens wide gates... ',\n",

Palate has hint of peat smoke which gives its flavors of turpentine, gasoline, plasticine, candle wax. There is a nice fruity front that suggests stone fruit jam, maybe fresh dates. Also very carbonated. Almost gets in the way of properly enjoying this ale. The predominant flavor in this stout is smoke, not char or caramelization as is usually the case, but smoke which makes me think this might have also been entered as a smoked ale instead of a stout. The smoke is tobacco smoke, stale cigarettes, mouthfeel after two cigars...ashtray.Finish is brief and smoky...what else. ',\n",

Having had some initial sips I left to get warmer as was a tad too cold. Medium bitter, roasted, the initial effect of the chili is to take away from the bitterness. Smooth, slightly viscous with a gentle carbonation. The chili comes through, however. It adds a pleasant warmth, especially to a sore throat.

       "  '330ml bottle. Murky, dark amber colour with small, creamy, moderately lasting and lacing, off-white to beige head. Leafy, spicy, fruity aroma, notes of lemon tea, black tea, an initial touch of raspberry gains not only weight but takes over the regime eventually. Taste is spicy, fruity, leafy, notes of raspberry, citrusy hoppy notes of lemon, interludes of black tea, lemon tea, slightly dirty, nutty, woody hints of - for my sake - coconut in the last third; slightly dry finish. Very nice raspberry notes, strange and minimally unpleasant interference of what must be the coconut - a bit weird overall. ',\n",

Palate - close to medium bodied with a tangy texture! There is a long dry finish but then it gets sweet on the end. And the sourness slowly returns. Overall - an anomaly, a one off.

There was a fresh & quite hoppy start to the beer as it came through with subtle bitterness & a few earthy flavours at points. There was a couple of background fruits that appeared around the middle & touches of biscuit featured heavily too. Without being an overly complex beer, there was still enough to keep me interested & Iâ\\x80\\x99d be tempted to try more from the brewery now given the vast improvement between this & the last from them that I tried.

Resinous pine and pithy lemon on the nose. Fairly high carbonation, with a big lupulin hit but little hop flavour, theres some grassy/cereal malt there instead. Bitter and dry finish. An enjoyable beer but needs more late hops. Great level of dry hopping though.official bottle sampled 11/5/14Similar to before but with increased resin and lemon pith notes in the flavour giving something akin to hophead, albeit at a higher strength.

Bitter hers and mild malt in the aroma, some fruity notes and hints of pine and citrus. Moderate sweet with somewhat modest hoppy flavours, but a rather bitter finish. Quite okay. Worked well with Chili con carne, but feels slightly unbalanced.  ',\n",

The mainpart is mild, not too sweet or malty, so that the hop floralness can be tasted at full range. Hints of pine, even a bit viscous. The 5.5% are ideal for this brew. The aftertaste is long and intense: Pine, hints of earthy floralness, fresh and easy drinkable. Not too bitter till the end. The floral pine-aroma remains very long in the mouth.

       "  '500ml bottle in Maloneâ\\x80\\x99s, Glasgow:This one was a surprisingly good offering from the brewery & miles better than anything I have tried from them before, I almost never ordered this one based on previous beer from the brewery but this one has definitely changed my opinion of their beers & Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be on the look out for more of theirs the next time Iâ\\x80\\x99m in Ireland. There was a lot of citrus & pine but the biggest surprise with this beer was the sweetness thanks to tonnes of vanilla & butterscotch throughout. It was an easy beer to drink with a great balance & is definitely one Iâ\\x80\\x99d have again. ',\n",

Brewed in County Doyne, or Down, depending on your accent. Dark golden yellow or pale orange, hazy, a few bubbles, dense foamy white head, thick lacing. Aroma is spicy, malted milk biscuits, yoghurt, mango lassi, buttery. A bit weird. Body is light, spritzy carbonation, quite foamy. Taste is spicy sodawater, some burnt ashy notes, gooseberry, a little medicinal, lightly floral. A bit thin. The label tells me to \"Expect tropical fruit, citrus and resinous pine\" - maybe it delivers a little pine but itâ\\x80\\x99s mostly as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve described it. OK, but was hoping for more.

Dirty Amber with slight pink hue. Small white head. Suspended yeast. Sweet caramel malt and oat nose. Medium light body, very soft fizz. Mouth coating but not too oily. More oats and cereal with underlying tangerine and melon. Medium bitter quite wet finish. I'm not sure about the oat base but have to applaud the effort and intent with the fresh and local hops including the 'particularly vigorous wild Irish hop'. Look forward to trying the others in the range.  \",\n",
