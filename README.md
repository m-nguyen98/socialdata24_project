# Final Project - Social Data Analysis and Visualization (02806)

The RateBeer and BeerAdvocate datasets can be requested by writing a mail to s194378@dtu.dk

## Project Assignment A

The first part of the final project is an 1 minute movie, which should explain the central idea/concept that you will investigate in your final project. You're making the movie so that the TAs and I can give you feedback, and so that other groups can steal your ideas (and you can steal ideas from them). The movie must contain the following:

- An explanation of the central idea behind your final project, e.g., think about questions such as
  - What is the idea?
  - Which datasets do you need to explore the idea?
  - Why is it interesting?

- A mock-up of the visualization that you wish to build. (Anything is fine here. Pen and paper, MS Paint, Inkscape, D3, Midjourney (or any other LLM), anything is OK).

- Make sure you answer the questions
  - What genre is it? (for _Genres_, see section 4.3 of the Segel and Heer paper)
  - Why is that genre right for telling the story you want to communicate with the data

- A walk-through of your preliminary data-analysis, addressing
  - What is the total size of your data? (MB, number of rows, number of variables, etc)
  - What are other properties? (What is the date range? Is it geo-data?, then a quick plot of locations, etc.)
  - Show the fundamental distributions of the data (similar to the work we did on SF crime data)

But other than that, there are no constraints. And we do appreciate funny/inventive/beautiful movies, although the academic content is most important. Note that we'll display the movie to the entire class.

(The maximum length is 1 minutes, but its OK if the movie is shorter.)

## Project Assignment B: "The Viz and the Notebook"

The deliverables for your Final project are:

**A website with your visualizations and accompanying text**. I recommend you structure it as one of the key types of data story (cf. the Segel paper). The website should tell the story about the data that you're interested in getting across.
- The website should contain visualizations to let the reader explore the data that you're interested in getting across.
- Some them should be interactive.

Your analysis behind the scenes can be technical and as advanced as you like (in fact the goal is to show you can combine data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization), but the website itself should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your data driven insights across to a non-scientific reader (think of a friend from DTU who hasn't taken this class as the audience).

The idea is that you can create much more complex, dynamic and interactive analysis (and visualizations) using the dynamic possibilities that a website affords. It is a way for you to present your work in a way that everyone can understand it (like something you could show your parents).

**An explainer Jupyter Notebook.** The explainer notebook should contain all the behind the scenes data-analysis stuff, details on the dataset, why you've selected these particular visualizations, explanations methodology, etc.

**More about the website**

The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you've learned in class. The website should be self-contained and tell the story without the need for the details in the explainer notebook (the purpose of the explainer notebook is to provide additional details for interested/scientific readers).

**More on the explainer notebook**

The notebook should contain your analysis and code. Please structure it into the following sections

1. **Motivation.**
   - What is your dataset?
   - Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?
   - What was your goal for the end user's experience?

2. **Basic stats. Let's understand the dataset better**
   - Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.
   - If relevant, talk about your machine-learning.

4. **Genre. Which genre of data story did you use?**
   - Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of _Visual Narrative_ (Figure 7 in Segel and Heer). Why?
   - Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of _Narrative Structure_ (Figure 7 in Segel and Heer). Why?

5. **Visualizations.**
   - Explain the visualizations you've chosen.
   - Why are they right for the story you want to tell?

6. **Discussion. Think critically about your creation**
   - What went well?
   - What is still missing? What could be improved? Why?

7. **Contributions. Who did what?**
   - You should write (just briefly) which group member was the main responsible for which elements of the assignment. (I want you guys to understand every part of the assignment, but usually there is someone who took lead role on certain portions of the work. That's what you should explain).
   - It is not OK simply to write "All group members contributed equally".

8. **References**
   - Make sure that you use references when they're needed and follow academic standards.
